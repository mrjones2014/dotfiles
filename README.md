# Dotfiles

These are my NixOS and macOS dotfiles, packaged as a Nix flake, using [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

For info on how to set up my Nix flake, see the [setup instructions](https://mjones.network/my-dotfiles.html).

These Nix configs currently manage:

- My homelab server (`.#homelab`)
- My gaming PC (`.#tower`)
- My Thinkpad laptop (`.#nixbook`)
- My MacBook Pro (`.#darwin`, with `home-manager` and `nix-darwin`)

## Caveats

I try my best to make things work for both macOS and Linux (NixOS), please let me know if something does not work.
