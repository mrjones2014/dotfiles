These are my NixOS and macOS dotfiles, packaged as a Nix flake, using [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

For info on how to set up my Nix flake, see the [setup instructions](https://mjones.network/my-dotfiles.html).

## Caveats

I try my best to make things work for both macOS and Linux (NixOS), please let me know if something does not work.
Windows is absolutely not supported, since Nix does not support Windows. [Microsoft Windows itself is malware/spyware](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html) anyway.
