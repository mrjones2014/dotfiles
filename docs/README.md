# Hi there, I'm Mat ðŸ‘‹

</div>
<hr>

Iâ€™m currently working as a developer at 1Password. I'm an automation enthusiast, Neovim user, and generally a command line junkie. I'm also a Certified Scrum Master.

My favorite programming languages currently are Rust, Go, and Lua. I like making Neovim plugins, command line tools, and other developer tools.

I'm really passionate about user privacy and sovereignty, Developer Experienceâ„¢, solving problems for developers, and creating developer workflows people love to use.
I maintain [`legendary.nvim`](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim) and [`smart-splits.nvim`](https://github.com/mrjones2014/smart-splits.nvim),
as well as some other side projects.
