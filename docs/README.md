# Hi there, I'm Mat 👋

<hr>

I’m currently working as a developer at 1Password. I'm a software engineer with a passion for developer experience, user privacy and sovereignty, open source, Rust, and NixOS.

My favorite programming languages currently are Rust, Nix, and Lua (for Neovim plugins). I like making Neovim plugins, command line tools, and other developer tools.

I maintain [`legendary.nvim`](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim) and [`smart-splits.nvim`](https://github.com/mrjones2014/smart-splits.nvim) (Neovim plugins),
as well as some other side projects.
